# Astronomic Calendar
## What is _Astronomic Calendar_?
The goal is to provide a script that prompts a calendar which takes different options to adapt to a more modern way of life and away from religious _dogmas_.

The project aims to create a _Universal_, _Multicultural_ and _Secular_ calendar that can be use __Worldwide__.
## Funcionamiento
The __Astronomic Calendar__ is organized in _years_, _months_, _weeks_ and _days_.
A __year__ is a full cicle of the _Earth_ arround the _Sun_. The actual difference is that leap years are not preset for regular ciles, but for the actual date of the _equinox_ of March.
__Months__ are defined by the phases of the _Moon_. So, for every full cicle of _Moon_ __phases__ we have a month. It is still to be determined if months, as well as years, are defined by the actual phases or they are prestablished in regular cicles.
Since there is not a predetermined fixed number of _lunar phases_ for every year, months will vary between 12 and 13 per year.
__Weeks__ have 5 days each. Therefore, every year (except leap years) has 73 _weeks_.
This determines, as well, that every year begins with a new week. In the case of _leap years_ a day is added to the last week of the year as a __global festivity_.
## Actual progress
This is a very early stage so don't expect much yet.
